    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Neural Network (NN) is a powerful tool and
        one can find its exciting successes in various fields recently.
        In neurology, it can be used to detec lesions, predict
        treatment outcomes, and assist diagnosis. However, its ability of
        discovering the working mechanism of the brain remains limited,
        because none of the generic NNs has a clear biophysical interpretability,
        although NN is originally inspired by biological studies.
        In this project, we focus on not only its ability of reproducing
        observed bio-signals but also it biophysical meaning.
        Rather than manipulating standard neural net models and
        then trying to load them with biophysical meaning,
        we customize neural network from scratch based on the previous
        most advanced biophysical model, Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM).
        We propose a new Generalized Recurrent Neural Network
        (GRNN) and show that DCM can be cast as a specific case of it.
        The resulting DCM_RNN links the power/flexibility of
        NN and the biophysical interpretability of DCM.

    <h2> Dynamic Causal Modelling</h2>

    <img style="width:172px;height:295px;"  src="assets/images/diagram_of_DCM.png" >

    <p>
        Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) is a highly nonlinear generative
        model used to infer the causal architecture of coupled dynamical
        systems in the brain from biophysical measurements,
        such as functional MRI (fMRI) data. The causal architecture indicates
        how the neural activities interact with each other between distributed
        brain regions and how input stimuli may alter the pattern. Fig. 1 shows
        a high level overview of DCM. It is the only one  that
        explicitly models the complete processes from inputs, neural
        activities, hemodynamics, to MRI imaging, and thus considered to be the
        most biologically plausible as well as the most technically advanced
        fMRI modeling method.
    </p>

    <p>
        Neural activity is an abstract description of the activity
        (neuron firing)  in brain regions, one scalar per region. DCM assumes
        the neural activities are couple between regions in a bilinear way:
    </p>

    <img style="width:236px;height:85px;" src="assets/images/x_evolving.png">

    <p class="p_continued">
        where x is the neural activity. Dot above a variable means its temporal
        derivative.  u is the experimental or exogenous stimulation,
        taken as the input of DCM.  m indicates the number of experimental
        stimuli. Multiple stimuli, such as visual, acoustic, and tactile,
        may present in a single experiment.  Subscript j means the jth entry
        in a vector or the th matrix of in a matrix set. A, B, C
        are parameters to be estimated, loosely referred to as the effective
        connectivity. Fig. 2 visualizes how the matrices encode the causal
        architecture in the brain.

        Ni is the i-th brain region. u is input stimulus.</figcaption>

    <p>
        Neural activity consumes oxygen and causes changes in blood
        supply and blood oxygen content. MRI scanner can detect these
        changes and record them as fMRI images. These are described in
        the hemodynamic module and MRI imaging module which are highly
        nonlinear. One overview of DCM with details are shown in Fig. 3.
    </p>

    <figcaption>Fig. 3 Overview of DCM with details. Although it seems very complex,
        one can read the flow by noticing u is experimental input, x is neural
        activity, s is a transitional signal, f is blood flow, v is blood
        Volume, q is the deoxyhemoglobin content, and y is fMRI signal.</figcaption>


    <h2>DCM-RNN</h2>
    <p>
        At the first glance, it is hard to see any correspondence between DCM
        and any generic neural network, such as CNN or LSTM.
        And it is the case :) However, we propose a generalization of
        vanilla RNN (GRNN) and made it to cast DCM as
        a special configuration of GRNN.
    </p>

    <h3>A generalization of vanilla RNN</h3>

    <p>
        The vanilla RNN models the relationship between its input and its
        output as
    </p>


    <img style="width:300px;height:71px;"   src="assets/images/classic_rnn.png">
    <figcaption>where x is the input, h is the hidden state, and y is the output.
        W and b are weighting matrix and bias, the tunable parameters.
        Subscript t indicates time and superscript are used in content to
        differentiate parameters. f are nonlinear functions.</figcaption>

    <p>
        The vanilla RNN is too simple to accommodating the complexity of DCM.
        We generalize it by adding more nonlinearity:
    </p>


    <img style="width:300px;height:66px;" src="assets/images/GRNN.png">


    <p class="p_continued">
        where the φ's are the extra nonlinear functions added which may be
        parameterized by ξ's. It greatly extends the flexibility of RNN.
    </p>

    <h3>Convert DCM to DCM_RNN</h3>
    <p>
        The key idea of the conversion turns out to be very simple.
        The only tricks are a simple approximation and equation terms
        rearrangement. The approximation is
    </p>


    <img style="width:146px;height:59px;"  src="assets/images/approximation.png">


    <p class="p_continued">
        where ∆t is the time interval between two adjacent fMRI samples.
        This approximation is valid as long as ∆t is small.
        Substitute it into the original equation. One obtains
    </p>


    <img style="width:603px;height:106px;" src="assets/images/x_equation.png">


    <p class="p_continued">
        It can be visualized as a piece of neural network
    </p>


    <img style="width:318px;height:186px;"  src="assets/images/x_nn_piece.png">

    <p class="p_continued">
        Similar trick can be applied for other parts of DCM and one can obtain
        DCM_RNN as shown in Fig. 4.

    <h2>Advantages of DCM_RNN</h2>
    <p>

        DCM_RNN is more than a simple reformatting of DCM.
        It provides a new form of model inversion of DCM, which tends to be more noise robust than the traditional Variational Bayes.
        It can be combined with other deep learning neural networks to study brain under complex stimuli.
