                    Classical neural network focuses on performance of specific tasks,
                    such as classification, tracking, considering little about internal meaning.
                    We use neural network as a tool to understand the causal architecture in the brain.
                    We design neural network deep down based on previous biophysical model, Dynamic Causal Modeling
                    (DCM), proposing a generalized RNN (GRNN) and show that DCM can be cast as a specific GRNN.
                    The new DCM-RNN extends DCM with a more flexible framework supporting more biophysically
                    plausible modifications, new estimation methods, and neural network compatibility.
                    In functional MRI (fMRI) experiments, DCM-RNN is shown to achieve more accurate causal
                    architecture estimation and has more capacity of discovering simpler models among all the
                    candidates than the classical DCM.

                    People’s opinions about algorithms may be biased by incomplete comparison.
                    Recently, researchers try to incorporate adaptive dictionaries into MRI Compressive Sensing (CS)
                    algorithms to enhance MRI reconstruction and they compare their proposals with other adaptive
                    dictionary algorithms. DLMRI is used as the baseline and up to 9dB image PSNR enhancement is
                    often reported, which makes dictionary learning seem an extreme appealing research field.
                    However, no comparison with a fixed-dictionary algorithm has been made which prevents a fair
                    evaluation of the role of adaptive dictionaries in the first place. Herein, we propose
                    a Fixed-Dictionary Baseline and compare it with the current baseline, DLMRI,
                    and state-of-the-art algorithms, UNITE-MRI and DDTF-MRI on the same data set.
                    Our study reveals that, the previous baseline DLMRI appears very week, even inferior to the
                    simpler FDB algorithm. Reporting marked improvement over DLMRI can thus just be misleading.

                    It's a course project I advised.
                    Two brilliant and passionated master students at NYU,
                    Megan Hardy and Sumanto Pal,
                    start their adventure of image processing and deep learning.
                    Different objects of a painting typically have distinctively different
                    styles i.e. textures and color compositions while previous neural
                    painting works abstract a global style from a painting
                    and apply it globally onto a photo.
                    In this project, we separate objects of interest in both painting
                    and real content photo and apply an art style only to the
                    corresponding objects. For example, abstract style from a flower
                    in a painting and apply it onto a flower in a real content photo.
                    It creates unique aesthetic experiences.
