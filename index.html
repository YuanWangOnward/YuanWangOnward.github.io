                    Classical neural network focuses on performance of specific tasks,
                    such as classification, tracking, considering little about internal meaning.
                    We use neural network as a tool to understand the causal architecture in the brain.
                    We design neural network deep down based on previous biophysical model, Dynamic Causal Modeling
                    (DCM), proposing a generalized RNN (GRNN) and show that DCM can be cast as a specific GRNN.
                    The new DCM-RNN extends DCM with a more flexible framework supporting more biophysically
                    plausible modifications, new estimation methods, and neural network compatibility.
                    In functional MRI (fMRI) experiments, DCM-RNN is shown to achieve more accurate causal
                    architecture estimation and has more capacity of discovering simpler models among all the
                    candidates than the classical DCM.

                    It's a course project I advised.
                    Two brilliant and passionated master students at NYU,
                    Megan Hardy and Sumanto Pal,
                    start their adventure of image processing and deep learning.
                    Different objects of a painting typically have distinctively different
                    styles i.e. textures and color compositions while previous neural
                    painting works abstract a global style from a painting
                    and apply it globally onto a photo.
                    In this project, we separate objects of interest in both painting
                    and real content photo and apply an art style only to the
                    corresponding objects. For example, abstract style from a flower
                    in a painting and apply it onto a flower in a real content photo.
                    It creates unique aesthetic experiences.

                    Researcher do a lot of literature survey, which is always a pain,
                    pain, in the sense that it is hard to get the 'big picture' of a field
                    facing the endless and messy papers. There should be tools allowing people
                    to find out the most influential works and
                    see how the studies of a field evolves along time.
                    But I cannot find such one. So I decided to make one myself.
                    The main functionality of this tool includes:
                    <ul>
                        <li >
                            Given a set of papers, visualize their relationship as a graph.
                            Graph nodes are papers and they should be arranged chronologically.
                            Graph edges indicate citation relationship.
                            Highlights of each paper should be attached to the nodes.
                            Nodes should be visualized in the way to make it very easy to see the
                            most impactful ones.
                        </li>
                        <li >
                            Features of each paper should be attached to the nodes.
                            Influential papers should be highlighted.
                        </li>
                        <li >
                            Given a set of papers, the tool should be able to find the most related
                            papers in terms of citation relationship. Namely, expand your pool.
                        </li>
